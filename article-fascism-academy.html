        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">On January 26, 2026, Peter Thiel, an American billionaire hostile to democracy, was received with great pomp at the French Academy of Moral and Political Sciences. Far from being anecdotal, this invitation reveals the underground connections between American technofascism, traditionalist Catholic networks, and the normalization of the far right in France.</p>

      <section class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">

        <blockquote class="text-xl">
          "I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible"
        </blockquote>

        <p>This sentence is not taken from a political science textbook on authoritarian regimes. It was written by Peter Thiel, in an essay published in 2009 in the libertarian journal <em>Cato Unbound</em>. Sixteen years later, its author was welcomed in Paris, within one of the most prestigious institutions of the French Republic.</p>

        <p>On January 26, 2026, Peter Thiel spoke behind closed doors at the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences, invited by the philosophy section. The session, kept secret until the last moment, was officially about "technology and the future of the West." According to testimonies gathered, the billionaire reportedly developed an eschatological vision mixing references to the Antichrist, criticism of democratic "decadence," and praise for technological disruption as an instrument of power.</p>

        <p>Outside, about a hundred protesters brandished a banner reading "Palantir-toi" (a French pun meaning "Get out, Palantir") — a sardonic wordplay referring to the mass surveillance company co-founded by Thiel. The Association of Philosophy Teachers in Public Education (APPEP) had published a statement denouncing this invitation, recalling the openly anti-democratic positions of the businessman.</p>

        <p>But who is Peter Thiel really? And why should his presence in Paris alert us to the state of our democracy?</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-deep-violet">Portrait of an Architect of Technofascism</h2>

        <p>Peter Thiel, 58, is not just another Silicon Valley entrepreneur. Co-founder of PayPal alongside Elon Musk, first outside investor in Facebook (where he sat on the board until 2022), he is above all the creator of Palantir Technologies — a company whose name, borrowed from the seeing-stones in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, perfectly summarizes its ambition: to see everything, know everything, control everything.</p>

        <p>In his 2009 essay, Thiel did not merely express doubts about democracy. He explicitly pointed out what he considered the causes of its dysfunction:</p>

        <blockquote>
          "Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women — two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians — have rendered the notion of 'capitalist democracy' into an oxymoron."
        </blockquote>

        <p>Women's right to vote as an obstacle to progress. Welfare as a hindrance to freedom. This gives a measure of the scope of the political project.</p>

        <p>But Thiel does not merely theorize. He acts. In 2016, he funded Donald Trump's campaign and became one of his advisors. In 2022, he invested $15 million in J.D. Vance's Senate campaign — now Vice President of the United States. He maintains close ties with Curtis Yarvin, a neoreactionary ideologue who advocates for the abolition of the American Constitution in favor of "techno-authoritarian city-states" run by all-powerful CEOs.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-deep-violet">Palantir: The Machine for Surveillance and Deportation</h2>

        <p>Palantir Technologies, co-founded by Thiel in 2003 with financial support from In-Q-Tel — the CIA's investment fund — develops massive data analysis software used by intelligence services and law enforcement agencies around the world.</p>

        <p>In the United States, Palantir has become the central tool of the Trump administration's immigration policy. In April 2025, ICE signed a $30 million contract with the company to develop "ImmigrationOS" — an artificial intelligence platform designed to "identify, track, and deport" immigrants.</p>

        <p>The system aggregates data from multiple government sources: tax files, Social Security databases, license plate records, air travel histories. It allows agents to approve raids, generate legal documents, and organize deportation flights — all from a single interface.</p>

        <p>Thirteen former Palantir employees signed an open letter in May 2025, titled "The Scouring of the Shire" (a reference to <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>), denouncing the dismantling of the company's ethical safeguards:</p>

        <blockquote>
          "Companies are bowing to the Trump administration, suppressing dissent, and aligning with its xenophobic, sexist, and oligarchic agenda."
        </blockquote>

        <p>In France, the DGSI has been using Palantir tools since 2016, initially deployed urgently after the November 13, 2015 attacks. In December 2025, the contract was renewed for three more years.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-deep-violet">The French Architects of Conquest: Media, Money, and Politics</h2>

        <p>If Peter Thiel embodies the American side of technofascism, France has its own hegemony builders. Three forces are converging today to reshape the French political landscape: a media empire, a machine for financing the radical right, and a far-right party in the process of normalization.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">The Bolloré Empire: Manufacturing Consent</h3>

        <p>Vincent Bolloré, France's 11th richest person, has methodically built a media empire in service of an ultraconservative vision. CNews, Europe 1, the Journal du Dimanche, Canal+: these media outlets daily broadcast a flow of information oriented toward the obsessions of the far right — immigration, insecurity, "wokism," Islam.</p>

        <p>The figures documented by Reporters Without Borders in November 2025 are eloquent: on CNews, during prime time (7am-10am and 6pm-9pm), the far right accounts for 40.6% of exposure time compared to 15.4% for the left.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">The Pericles Project: 150 Million for Victory</h3>

        <p>Pierre-Édouard Stérin, 52, founder of Smartbox, France's 81st richest person and a tax exile in Belgium since 2012, revealed the extent of his ambitions in 2024.</p>

        <p>The "Pericles Project" plans €150 million over ten years to "enable ideological, electoral, and political victory" for declared values: the family as "the foundation of society," the "predominant place of European and Christian civilization," and the fight against "socialism, wokism, Islamism, and immigration."</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">The RN: From Conviction to Normalization</h3>

        <p>On March 31, 2025, Marine Le Pen was sentenced to four years in prison — two of them to be served — and five years of ineligibility with immediate enforcement for embezzlement of public funds. For more than ten years (2004-2016), the party had people paid by the European Parliament who were actually working for its French activities. Damage: €2.9 million.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-deep-violet">Systemic Racism as Infrastructure</h2>

        <p>On June 26, 2025, the European Court of Human Rights ruled against France for discriminatory identity checks — a first. People perceived as "Arab, Black, or North African" have a 28% chance of being checked multiple times, compared to 12% for people perceived as white. Young racialized men are four times more likely to undergo at least one check, and twelve times more likely to undergo a "thorough" check.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-deep-violet">Algorithmic Video Surveillance: Laboratory of Social Control</h2>

        <p>The Paris 2024 Olympic Games served as a testing ground for a new surveillance technology: algorithmic video surveillance (AVS). Under the guise of counter-terrorism, France became the first country in the European Union to legalize these systems.</p>

        <p>Amnesty International warns: "From algorithmic video surveillance to facial recognition, there is only one step. Technically, it would only be a feature to activate on AVS software."</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-deep-violet">A Convergence of Threats</h2>

        <p>What strikes in this investigation is the convergence of actors and strategies. Peter Thiel, received at the French Academy three days after the induction of Bernard Arnault — France's richest person — in the presence of Vincent Bolloré and Rachida Dati. American libertarian billionaires connected to French traditionalist Catholic networks. Surveillance companies under contract with intelligence services.</p>

        <p>What philosopher Achille Mbembe calls "necropolitics" — the power to decide who can live and who must die — finds in these convergences a troubling relevance. When ImmigrationOS allows tracking and deporting human beings with Amazon Prime's logistical efficiency, when software decides who is "suspicious" in public space, when media dehumanize entire populations daily, the conditions for institutionalized violence are in place.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-acid-green">What We Can Do</h2>

        <p><strong>Inform yourself and inform others.</strong> The investigations cited in this article — those of Mediapart, Disclose, Basta!, StreetPress, La Quadrature du Net, RSF — constitute essential documentation work. Read them, share them, support them financially.</p>

        <p><strong>Name things.</strong> What is happening is not a "drift" or a "slide." It is a coordinated offensive against democracy, led by identifiable actors with considerable means. Refuse euphemisms.</p>

        <p><strong>Mobilize.</strong> Past victories have been won at the local level. Residents of Saint-Étienne had a project for "suspicious noise detector" microphones cancelled in 2019. Parents in Marseille and Nice prevented the installation of facial recognition gates at high schools.</p>

        <p><strong>Build solidarities.</strong> The most exposed people — racialized, immigrants, precarious — are on the front lines. Support them concretely, not just symbolically.</p>

        <p><strong>Refuse resignation.</strong> Fascism advances because it succeeds in convincing that there is no alternative. Every act of resistance, however modest, demonstrates the opposite.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-deep-violet">Conclusion: The Door and the Wall</h2>

        <p>On January 26, 2026, Peter Thiel entered through the great door of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences. Someone opened that door. Someone decided that this man's ideas deserved to be heard in one of the most prestigious places of the Republic.</p>

        <p>This is not an accident. It is a choice. And this choice tells us something about the state of our institutions, about the porosity of French elites to authoritarian ideologies, about the normalization of what should remain unacceptable.</p>

        <p>Fascism does not always knock at the door. Sometimes, we open it for him. Sometimes, he is already in the house, sitting in front of the television, connected to databases, ready to decide who belongs and who must leave.</p>

        <p><strong>Our work is to build the wall. Brick by brick, investigation by investigation, mobilization by mobilization.</strong></p>

        <p><em>Fascism advances because we let it advance. We refuse to look away.</em></p>
